Custom Built Cat Feeder

**WIP**

Are the comments vehemently excessive? Yes.

Was it a good learning experience? Also yes. Sue me.

Admittedly, I had started this project while my soul cat was still alive and losing him to cancer really halted production. So currently the mechanical components remain in the basement unfinished but I'll make it back to them soon.
