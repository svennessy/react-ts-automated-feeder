Custom Built Cat Feeder

**WIP**

Is

there an excessive amount of comments? Yes.

Was it a good learning experience? Also yes so sue me.

Admittedly, I had started this project while my soul cat was still alive and losing him to cancer really halted production. So currently the mechanical components remain in the basement unfinished but I'll make it back to them soon.
